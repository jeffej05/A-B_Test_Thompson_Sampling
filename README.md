# A-B_Test_Thompson_Sampling
CTR A/B Test with Thompson Sampling

This analysis validates the effectiveness of Thompson sampling over traditional A/B tests. Over time, the algorithm will
reduce wasted impressions and maximize CTR in real-time. It does this by converging on the best performing ad variant
by optimizing on the ad with the highest beta distribution theta value. It has been demonstrated that Thompson sampling has 
once the best long-term optimization results over other methods such as UCB and episolon-greedy.
